Name: Luiggi Centeno Cucche
Database: Reference Interest Rate of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru
Description:
The Reference Interest Rate of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is a pivotal tool used by the Central Bank to influence financial conditions and the overall economy. This rate represents the cost of money and directly impacts interest rates in the national financial market. It's a crucial indicator that affects loans, investments, and monetary policies in the country.
Interest:
My main interest would be to explore how changes in the reference rate affect different sectors of the Peruvian economy, such as consumer credit, business investment, or overall economic growth. Furthermore, I'd like to understand how this rate relates to other key economic indicators, like inflation or unemployment, and how it has evolved over time.
